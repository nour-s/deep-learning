# Deep Learning

I graduated from Deep Learning Udacity Nanodegree and I wanted to share my projects that I have done during the study.
During which I was able to train neural networks to do complicated tasks like recognizing handwritten digits, classifying dogs breed, transfer style from image to image, face recognition ..etc.

Here you will see a list of of all my projects done during.

## [Handwritten Digits Recognition](handwritten-digits-recognition/mnist_mlp_solution_with_validation.ipynb "Handwritten Digits Recognition")

One of the fun projects where I trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy up to **97%**

## [Visualizing Convolutional Networks](convolutional-network-visualization/conv_visualization.ipynb "Visualizing Convolutional Networks")
It is important when training a Convolutional Network to visualize what the newtork see of your data. It helps you see with the computer eyes, for example in the picture, you can see how the network identify the edges of the car in different way for each filter.

## [Sentiment Classification](sentiment-classification/sentiment-classification-solution.ipynb "Sentiment Classification")

The project is about building a network to predict sentiment (positive or negative) in movie reviews.

## [Bike Rental Ridership Prediction](bike-sharing-rental-ridership/bike-sharing-rental-ridership.ipynb "Bike Rental")

The project is about building a network neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.
Based on data collected over a passed year.

The trained network could predict the future demand on the bike riding rental with accuracy up to **80%**

## [Analyzing Student Data](student-admissions/student-admissions.ipynb "Student Admissions")

The project is to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:

-   GRE Scores (Test)
-   GPA Scores (Grades)
-   Class rank (1-4)

## [Gradient Descent](gradient-descent/gradient-descent.ipynb "Gradient Descent")

In the this project, I was able to implement the gradient descent algorithm on the following sample dataset with two classes.

![Gradient Descent](assets/gradient-descent.png)

Implemented functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:

-   sigmoid: The sigmoid activation function.
-   output_formula: The formula for the prediction.
-   error_formula: The formula for the error at a point.
-   update_weights: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.
