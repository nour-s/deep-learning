# deep-learning

A repository of all my projects done during my Nanodegree course: Deep Learning at Udacity

## [Gradient Descent](gradient-descent/gradient-descent.ipynb "Gradient Descent")

In the this project, I was able to implement the gradient descent algorithm on the following sample dataset with two classes.

Implemented functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:

-   sigmoid: The sigmoid activation function.
-   output_formula: The formula for the prediction.
-   error_formula: The formula for the error at a point.
-   update_weights: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.

## [Analyzing Student Data](student-admissions/student-admissions.ipynb "Student Admissions")

The project is to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:

-   GRE Scores (Test)
-   GPA Scores (Grades)
-   Class rank (1-4)
