A repository of all my projects done during my Nanodegree course: Deep Learning at Udacity

## [Handwritten Digits Recognition](handwritten-digits-recognition/mnist_mlp_solution_with_validation.ipynb "Handwritten Digits Recognition")

One of the fun projects where I trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy up to **97%**

## [Sentiment Classification](sentiment-classification/sentiment-classification-solution.ipynb "Sentiment Classification")

The project is about building a network to predict sentiment (positive or negative) in movie reviews.

## [Bike Rental Ridership Prediction](bike-sharing-rental-ridership/bike-sharing-rental-ridership.ipynb "Bike Rental")

The project is about building a network neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.
Based on data collected over a passed year.

The trained network could predict the future demand on the bike riding rental with accuracy up to **80%**

## [Analyzing Student Data](student-admissions/student-admissions.ipynb "Student Admissions")

The project is to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:

-   GRE Scores (Test)
-   GPA Scores (Grades)
-   Class rank (1-4)

## [Gradient Descent](gradient-descent/gradient-descent.ipynb "Gradient Descent")

In the this project, I was able to implement the gradient descent algorithm on the following sample dataset with two classes.

![Gradient Descent](assets/gradient-descent.png)

Implemented functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:

-   sigmoid: The sigmoid activation function.
-   output_formula: The formula for the prediction.
-   error_formula: The formula for the error at a point.
-   update_weights: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.
