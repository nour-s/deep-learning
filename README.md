# deep-learning
A repository of all my projects done during my Nanodegree course: Deep Learning at Udacity 

## [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/nour-s/deep-learning/blob/master/gradient-descent/gradient-descent.ipynb "Gradient Descent")
In the this project, I was able to implement the gradient descent algorithm on the following sample dataset with two classes.

implemented functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:

* sigmoid: The sigmoid activation function.
* output_formula: The formula for the prediction.
* error_formula: The formula for the error at a point.
* update_weights: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.
